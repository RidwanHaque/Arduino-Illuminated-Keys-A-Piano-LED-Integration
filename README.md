Core Features
1. Guitar Hero-Style LED Learning
Note Highway: LEDs under keys brighten (dim ‚Üí 100%) to show upcoming notes.
Real-Time Feedback: Correct notes ‚Üí green fade; errors ‚Üí red pulse.
Adaptive Tempo: TensorFlow Lite adjusts song speed based on accuracy (Google edge AI).
2. Custom Play Modes
Recreational Lighting: React Native app controls all LEDs (rainbow/static colors, 0-100% brightness).
Play Response: Customize per-key LED color/duration on press (e.g., purple flash for 500ms).
3. Open-Source Ecosystem

FAANG-Ready Patterns
BLE Stack: Mirishes Amazon Sidewalk‚Äôs low-power device networking
Offline-First: AWS Amplify sync like Google‚Äôs Firebase
Type Safety: TypeScript enforces strict contracts (Microsoft Azure standards)
Hardware Interaction Example
When user selects "F√ºr Elise":
App sends MIDI file to ESP32 via BLE (packetized for reliability)
ESP32 parses MIDI and starts LED sequence
Real-time accuracy % sent back to app via BLE notifications
App updates AWS DynamoDB via Lambda trigger
